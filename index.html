Throughout the distribution of Beelieve units, our goal to provide the users a glimpse of hope and to reassure them to keep on believing in a better tomorrow remains the same. We’re also working hard to expand Beelieve production, solely to make more units more accessible in order to reach larger groups of people. With a place to stay and essential features, Beelieve lends affected individuals more time to get back up on their feet and fight again.</p>

He searched about countermeasure, then found out about Beelieve Portable Shelter for victims of the wildﬁre supported by a state government. Through the website, he found that the Beelieve tent could be installed not far from his work company, so he decided to apply immediately. After passing simple veriﬁcation by the site, he received a Believe unit after a short while and found that It was lighter than he thought. The unit was easy to install and the solar panels provide sufficient power to run the air filtering system and electricity in the unit. Because of Beelieve, he was able to stay close to the company and go to work although he lost his house. He was very satisﬁed about the Beelieve portable shelter.</p>
