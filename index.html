            <p>Just like bees resetting in a new hive, the main priority of Beelieve as a whole is to provide useful and comfortable shelter for the affected individuals. Throughout the distribution of Beelieve units, our goal to provide the users a glimpse of hope and to reassure them to keep on believing in a better tomorrow remains the same. We’re also working hard to expand Beelieve production, solely to make more units more accessible in order to reach larger groups of people. With a place to stay and essential features, Beelieve lends affected individuals more time to get back up on their feet and fight again. </p>

                        <p>Due to the severe wildﬁre, Tim’s house was totally burned to the ground. He searched about countermeasure, then found out about Beelieve Portable Shelter for victims of the wildﬁre supported by a state government. Through the website, he found that the Beelieve tent could be installed not far from his work company, so he decided to apply immediately. After passing simple veriﬁcation by the site, he received a Believe unit after a short while and found that It was lighter than he thought. The unit was easy to install and the solar panels provide sufficient power to run the air filtering system and electricity in the unit. Because of Beelieve, he was able to stay close to the company and go to work although he lost his house. He was very satisﬁed about the Beelieve portable shelter.</p>

                    <p>The evacuation order was issued after wildﬁre began to spread. Gina rushed out of the home with her family. She spent the night at a temporary ﬁre emergency shelter. Then, she completely lost her house due to the wildﬁre so she needed a place to stay with her family for a few days. She recalls the article in the newspaper about Beelieve portable shelter where it supports victims by the state government who lost their homes due to wildﬁre. She accessed the website and authenticate that her house was currently in a wildﬁre area. She then found information that each unit can accommodate up to 1 to 2 people, so she applied 3 units for 5 family members. Beelieve is perfect for a family of 5 because it is possible to connect up to 3 units. Gina was able to stay with her family in Beelieve for 2 weeks, so she could buy more time to find a place to stay. </p>
